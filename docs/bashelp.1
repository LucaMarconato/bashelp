.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]bashelp\f[] is a shell tool for bookmarking, tagging and searching
shell commands you often use and often forget.
.PP
All the commands saved are stored in a sqlite database, and each command
has an id, a short description and as many tags as needed to search for
it afterward.
When adding a command a unique id will be assigned to it, and showed
always near the command.
When refering to the command, for example modifying and removing it, his
id should be used.
.PP
It is possible, through \-\-import and \-\-export options, to save in a
simple txt file all those commands that were previously added to
\f[B]bashelp\f[] database and to load them again on a different
\f[B]bashelp\f[] installation.
.PP
\f[B]bashelp\f[] should work on any modern shell (bash and zsh).
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Just one option per time is accepted.
This reflects the fact that any option directly relates to an action of
the \f[B]bashelp\f[].
.PP
When passing \f[I]tag\f[] (\f[B]bashelp\f[] \f[I]tag\f[]) all commands
which have the corresponding, or a similar one, tag will be showed.
If \f[I]tag\f[] is passed, no other option should be passed.
.TP
.B \-a|\-\-add

It will open a nano instance on a template file to be filled with
details about the command to be added.
When the file is filled with information, just close nano using ctrl+x
and the command will be added.
